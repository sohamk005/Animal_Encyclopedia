# 🦁 Animal Encyclopedia

A comprehensive desktop application built with Python and Tkinter for quick access to detailed information about various animal species. The application prioritizes local data lookup and uses a public API as an intelligent fallback for broader coverage.

## ✨ Features

* **Dual Data Source:** Fetches information from a local `animals.json` file first, then seamlessly searches the API-Ninjas public API.
* **Intuitive GUI:** A clean, dark-themed user interface built with **Tkinter** and **ttk**.
* **Local Image Support:** Displays corresponding images for animals found in the local database.
* **Detailed Information:** Displays key data like scientific name, habitat, diet, and conservation status for both local and API results.
